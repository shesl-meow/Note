# Generating CSRs

## Generate a private key and a CSR

This command creates a 2048-bit private key (`domain.key`) and a CSR (`domain.csr`) from scratch:

```bash
$ openssl req \
       -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout domain.key \
       -out domain.csr
```

- The `-newkey rsa:2048` option specifies that the key should be 2048-bit, generated using the RSA algorithm.

- The `-nodes` option specifies that the private key should *not* be encrypted with a pass phrase. 
- The `-new` option, which is **not included here but implied**, indicates that a CSR is being generated.

## Generate a CSR from a existing private key

This command creates a new CSR (`domain.csr`) based on an existing private key (`domain.key`):

```bash
$ openssl req \
       -key domain.key \
       -new -out domain.csr
```

- The `-key` option specifies an existing private key (`domain.key`) that will be used to generate a new CSR. 
- The `-new` option indicates that a CSR is being generated.

## Generate a CSR from an existing certificate and private key

This command creates a new CSR (`domain.csr`) based on an existing certificate (`domain.crt`) and private key (`domain.key`):

```bash
$ openssl x509 \
       -in domain.crt \
       -signkey domain.key \
       -x509toreq -out domain.csr
```

- The `-x509toreq` option specifies that you are using an X509 certificate to make a CSR.
