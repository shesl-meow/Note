# VMware FT(Fault-Tolerant)

## Primary/Backup Replication

Two main replication approaches:

1. State Transfer: Primary replica executes and sends `new` state to backups machine;
2. **Replicated State Machine**: Primary just pass the raw external event to backups. Mostly used by recent industry and papers;

Overview:

- VM-FT consist of two machine: `primary` and `backup`. Primary deals with all external events and replicates it to backup through "logging channel";
- VM-FT emulates a local disk interface through two remote disk server.

## Log Entry

`events` can't determine all situation, FT must handle the following divergence:

1. 指令本身的差异：Most instructions execute identically;
2. 机器所处外部的信号差异：Input from external world: network packet, DMA data, OS interrupt, etc;
3. 并不是所有指令都是状态指令（唯一输入唯一输出的纯函数）。比如：读取当前时间、随机数发生器（某种意义上说与前者是一类）；
4. 并发与多核：Parallelism and multi-core races;

为了使得 `pirmary` 和 `backup` 的状态完全一样，我们就必须要处理上面列举的一些异常情况，在它们通信时将这些信息传递出去使得它们执行的代码完全一样。

So the `log entry` who transfers message between `Primary` and `Backup` should contain these message below:

- Instruction number, interrupt type, interrupt data;
- Example: 
  - When executing the **120120(instruction number)** instruction since boot;
  - Program get **network packet (interrupt type)**;
  - Carrying a **tcp hand shake ACK (interrupt data)**;

### Timer Interrupt

> How does FT handle timer interrupts?

Goal: Make sure primary and backup should see interrupt at totally same situation;

`Primary` should do:

1. FT fields the timer interrupt;
2. FT reads instruction number X from CPU;
3. FT send instruction number X on the logging channel to `Backup`;
4. FT delivers interrupt to `Primary` and resume executing;

`Backup` should do:

1. Ignores its own timer hardware;
2. `Backup` see instruction number X from logging channel **before** the exact instruction executed;
3. FT tells CPU to "interrupt me at instruction X";
4. FT mimics a timer interrupt to `Backup`;

### Network Interrupt

> How does FT handle arrival of network packet?

Goal: Exactly same as timer interrupt, with data designating.

`Primary` should do:

- Boosting: Tells NIC (Network Interface Controller) to copy packet data into FT's private "bounce buffer";
- At some point, NIC does DMA then interrupt:
  1. FT pause the primary;
  2. FT copies the "bound buffer" into `Primary`'s memory;
  3. FT simulates a NIC interrupt in `Primary`;
  4. FT send "packet data" and "instruction number" to `Backup` through log channel;

`Backup` should do:

1. `Backup` received instruction number from log stream;
2. FT tells CPU to interrupt at instruction X;
3. FT copies the data to backup memory and similates NIC interrupt in `Backup`;

### Bounce Buffer

What bounce buffer?

- Bounce buffer is a FT's memory area that store network packet data;

Why bounce buffer?

- We want the data to appear in memory at exactly the same point in execution of the `Primary` and `Backup`;

## More Rule

### Output Rule

Suppose we encountered the following situation:

- `Primary` crashes jsut after sending the reply to client;
- `Backup` doesn't receive any event from `Primary` because it has crashed;

Output rule was brought up to deal with this:

- `Primary` should repsonse to client after receiving `ACKnowledgement` from `Backup`;

### Split Brain

Suppose we encounter the following situation:

- Network between `Primary` and `Backup` has been cut over；
- So both machine think the other one is dead, and think it's the `Primary` and stop sending logging event;

This is a common problem called "split brain". FT creat a center server support atomic `test-and-set` instruction, machine who get flag can become `Primary`.

## Summary

When might FT be attractive?

- Critical but low-intensity services: name server;

- Services whose software is not convenient to modify;

What about replication for high-throughput services?

- Recommend: Applicative-level replicated state machines;
  - Example: Database state machine, database only support a limit set of command which is easier to transfer message;
- Result: less fine-grained synchronization (更细粒度的同步), less overhead;
