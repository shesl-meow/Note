# Generating SSL Certificates

If you would like to use an SSL certificate to secure a service but you do not require a CA-signed certificate, a valid (and free) solution is to sign your own certificates.

A common type of certificate that you can issue yourself is a *self-signed certificate*. Therefore, self-signed certificates should only be used if you do not need to prove your service's identity to its users (e.g. non-production or non-public servers).

## Generate a self-signed certificate

This command creates a 2048-bit private key (`domain.key`) and a self-signed certificate (`domain.crt`) from scratch:

```bash
$ openssl req \
       -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout domain.key \
       -x509 -days 365 -out domain.crt
```

- The `-x509` option tells `req` to create a self-signed certificate.
- The `-days 365` option specifies that the certificate will be valid for 365 days.
- A temporary CSR is generated to gather information to associate with the certificate.

## Generate a self-signed  certificate from a existing private key

This command creates a self-signed certificate (`domain.crt`) from an existing private key (`domain.key`):

```bash
$ openssl req \
       -key domain.key \
       -new \
       -x509 -days 365 -out domain.crt
```

- The `-x509` option tells `req` to create a self-signed certificate.
